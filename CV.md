     *Thesis title:* Semantic Data Integration for the Forest Observatory Applications. 
        -  Developed the Forest Observatory Ontology (ontology.forest-observatory.cardiff.ac.uk) and populated it with diverse wildlife datasets transformed into Resource Description Framework (RDF) graphs. The resulting ontology-based knowledge graph, with over 6 million triples, was used to predict elephant movements with 99.04% accuracy through deep learning and to apply semantic reasoning for forecasting poaching events. The semantic data integration approach was also extended to IoT data marketplaces to enable more precise data acquisition instead of bulk purchasing. 
    - MSc in Data Science, Cardiff University (2018–2019, Distinction): Advanced training in statistics, operational research, and machine learning. 
    - BSc in Computer Engineering, The Future University, Sudan (1995–2000): Recognised by UK NARIC. 
- Experience: 
    - Graduate Tutor, Cardiff University (2023–Present): Supervise undergraduate projects and assist modules’ instructors during lectures. 
    - Director, Cardiff Computer Centre (2013–Present): Design and build custom computers, repair hardware and software, and perform data recovery.
