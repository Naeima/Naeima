Education
PhD in Computer Science, Cardiff University (2020–2024)
Thesis title: Semantic Data Integration for the Forest Observatory Applications (Link).
•	Developed Forest Observatory Ontology and populated it with RDF datasets to create knowledge graphs (Ontology Link, w3id Link). 
•	Achieved 99.04% accuracy predicting elephant movements using AI and then applied semantic reasoning to predict poaching incidents.
MSc in Data Science, Cardiff University (2018–2019, Distinction)
•	Advanced training in statistics, operational research, and machine learning.
•	MSc project focused on predictive analytics using multivariate time series data.
BSc (Hons) in Computer Engineering, The Future University, Sudan (1995–2000)
•	Designed and developed embedded systems combining electronic circuits and custom software for real-world applications.
Experience
Graduate Tutor, Cardiff University (2023–Present)
•	Supervise undergraduate projects and provide academic support to module instructors.
Director, Cardiff Computer Centre- Wales, UK (2013–Present)
•	Design, build, and repair custom computer systems.
