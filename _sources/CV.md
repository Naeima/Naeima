#### Overview  
I am a computer scientist and researcher specialising in data science, semantic web technologies, and AI. My work addresses real-world challenges by creating ontologies, developing knowledge graphs, and applying automated reasoning. I collaborate across disciplines to deliver practical solutions and populate knowledge graphs with diverse datasets to support decision-making.
