### Education

#### Cardiff University / Prifysgol Caerdydd  
**Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Computer Science and Informatics**  
*2020 - 2024*  

- **Research Focus:**  
  *Semantic Data Integration for Forest Observatory Applications*  

- **Overview:**  
  Conducting innovative research to address challenges posed by research data silos in forest observatories. The work aims to develop semantic data integration frameworks to enable seamless data sharing, interoperability, and analysis across diverse data sources.

- **Contributions and Achievements:**  

  - Reviewed and compared 13 open data observatories to evaluate data management, data types, and challenges.  
  - Proposed semantic web technologies to integrate reseach data silos.  
  - Built the Forest Observatory Ontology (FOO) and integrated four wildlife datasets into a knowledge graph with over 6 million RDF triples.  
  - Used Google's TensorFlow and Keras framework to predict elephant movements, achieving 99.04% accuracy, outperforming existing benchmarks of 90.95% and 91.64%.  
  - Applied semantic reasoning to predict poaching incidents based on movements data.  
  - Adapted the approach for IoT data marketplaces, enabling granualar data queries and selective purchasing for AI training.  
  - Published findings in top peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences.
