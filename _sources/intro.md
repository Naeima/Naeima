## About Me 
 
I am a computer scientist and researcher with expertise in data science, semantic web technologies, and AI systems. My work addresses real-world challenges by creating ontologies, building knowledge graphs, and applying automated reasoning to develop practical solutions.  

One of my key projects is the Forest Observatory Ontology (FOO) (ontology.forest-observatory.cardiff.ac.uk) which I developed with expert input. I populated (FOO) with diverse wildlife datasets, especially from hard-to-reach populations, to form an ontology-based knowledge graph. This knowledge graph has been used to enable semantic reasoning and deep learning. For example, I used it to predict elephant movements with 99.04% accuracy, surpassing existing methods, and to detect potential poaching incidents.  

I have also extended my work to IoT data marketplaces. My approach allows users to query and purchase only the data needed for specific tasks, such as training AI models, making data usage more efficient and accessible.  

I am skilled in Python, SPARQL, and platforms like Stardog and GraphDB. By collaborating with experts from various disciplines, I ensure that semantic technologies are applied in practical ways, to break data silos.
