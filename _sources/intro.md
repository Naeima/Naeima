### Overview  

I am a computer scientist and researcher with expertise in data science, semantic web technologies, and AI systems. 
My work addresses real-world challenges by creating ontologies, building knowledge graphs, and applying automated reasoning.
I collaborate with experts across various fields to design practical ontologies, 
which I populate with diverse datasets to develop reliable knowledge graphs.

I used proven research methods to develop and publish the Forest Observatory Ontology (FOO) (https://ontology.forest-observatory.cardiff.ac.uk),
and its knowledge graphs. 
These knowledge graphs enable semantic reasoning and deep learning to make accurate predictions.

With skills in Python, SPARQL, and platforms like Stardog and GraphDB, I focus on making advanced technologies practical and accessible.
